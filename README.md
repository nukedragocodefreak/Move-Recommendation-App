# Developing a Movie Recommendation App (Web) - ProDev FE
Real-World Application
This project reflects a practical scenario where developers must build scalable, user-focused applications. By completing this project, participants gain experience in: - Integrating third-party APIs to fetch dynamic data. - Building robust and reusable components using modern frameworks. - Managing user data with local storage or APIs while prioritizing a seamless experience.

Overview
This case study involves creating a movie recommendation application where users can browse trending movies and receive recommendations tailored to their preferences. The project showcases dynamic routing, local data storage, and interactive UI design to deliver an engaging user experience.

Project Goals
The primary objectives of the movie recommendation app are:

Dynamic Routing
Implement dynamic routing using Next.js for detailed movie pages.
User Personalization
Enable users to save their favorite movies locally or via an API.
Interactive Dashboard
Build a responsive and visually appealing movie dashboard for browsing and recommendations.
Technologies Used
Next.js / React Native: For server-side rendering and dynamic routing.
TypeScript: To ensure type safety and scalable development.
Styled Components: For creating reusable, styled UI components.
Key Features
1. API Integration
Fetch and display trending and recommended movies using a public movie API.
Implement proper error handling and loading states during API calls.
2. Dynamic Routing
Create detailed pages for individual movies using Next.js dynamic routing.
